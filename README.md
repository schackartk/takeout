R functions for cleaning and tidying data obtained from [Google
Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/).

## Status

This package is in an early stage of development. Immediate goals are to
create functions that help with location related data (e.g.Â location
history, place reviews and ratings).

The goal of this project is more of an exercise for myself than to
create a tool for others. In that spirit though, I am trying to make it
relatively robust, for instance through the use of testing.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("schackartk/takeout")
```
